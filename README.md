## WIP - Work in progress

# Pure JS (vanilla) frontend + Django backend

🏓 Pong-withBugs-testing 🏓

Project Description:
This project, Pong-withBugs-testing, is a modified version of the original pong42 created for the ft_transcendence course. Built using a Django backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend, this version intentionally includes bugs. The goal is to provide a hands-on environment for testing and debugging in workshop settings, helping participants practice identifying and solving issues.
